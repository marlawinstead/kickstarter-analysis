Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Kickstarting With Excel

Overview of the Project
In this project, crowdfunding campaigns are analyzed to determine which specific factors lead to the most successful campaigns. The factors analyzed include data sets such as start date, end date, goal, length of campaign, and outcome of campaign. This is done through Excel in the form of pivot tables and graphs which allows me to optimize Louise’s campaign through data analytics.

Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise, a playwright, with her crowdfunding campaign. Louise wants to fund her play ‘Fever’ and mirror other successful campaigns to increase her play’s chance of success. This analysis looks at crowdfunding data to see which specific factors make a campaign more likely to succeed. Louise has a budget goal of at least $10,000 and would like a Kickstarter campaign that could raise the money as efficiently as possible.

Analysis and Challenges
In this project, we looked at Kickstarter campaign goals and start dates to see if those were factors in determining the outcome of a campaign. This was demonstrated using a pivot table, graph and excel formulas. Based on the data analyzed, it was determined that launch dates and the goal amount can heavily influence how successful a campaign will be.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Louise is crowdfunding for a play, so data has been filtered to show specific results for the category theater and then filtered again into the subcategory plays. The below chart represents the results.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We calculated the number of successful, failed and canceled plays based on goal. This was done using the COUNTIFS function in excel and was filtered for plays specifically. After getting the total number of each category, the totals were converted into percentages, represented in the graph below.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There is limited data on canceled theater campaigns especially when filtered for plays. When the number of canceled plays in filtered based on goals using the COUNTIFS function, the result is 0 every time.

Results
Two conclusions that can be drawn from outcomes based on launch date:

May is the most successful month to launch a campaign in. Following May, a decline is seen through the end of the year.
There is not much data to be shown for canceled plays and none represented at all during the month of October.
Conclusions that can be drawn from outcomes based on goals:

The most successful campaigns have a goal of less than $5,000 or from $35,000 to $40,000.
Campaigns are the least successful with a goal of $25,000.
Limitations of the Dataset:
The data set only shows crowdfunding campaigns between the years 2009-2017. We do not have the most up to date information to analyze.

Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create:
Another chart that could have been used is analyzing the relationship between the launch and end dates of the data set to see if there is a correlation between the length of time a campaign is crowdfunding for and the outcome of the campaign. This could then be represented by a pivot table.
